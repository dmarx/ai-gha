## Repository Setup

### Required Repository Settings

1. **Workflow Permissions**
   - Go to Repository Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions
   - Enable "Read and write permissions"
   - Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

2. **Branch Protection** (Optional but recommended)
   - Go to Repository Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules
   - Add rule for your main branch (e.g., `main` or `master`)
   - Enable:
     - "Require pull request reviews before merging"
     - "Require status checks to pass before merging"
   - Allow:
     - "Allow specific actors to bypass required pull requests"
     - Add "github-actions[bot]" to the bypass list

### Required Secrets and Variables

No additional secrets are required for basic functionality. The workflows use the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` which is automatically provided.

### Repository Setup Commands

If you're setting up using GitHub CLI, you can run these commands:
```bash
# Enable workflows
gh repo edit --enable-actions

# Set workflow permissions
gh api \
  --method PUT \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  "/repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/permissions/workflow" \
  -f default_workflow_permissions='write' \
  -F can_approve_pull_request_reviews=true

# Enable Issues (recommended for tracking)
gh repo edit --enable-issues
```

Replace `OWNER/REPO` with your repository details.

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow Permission Errors**
   - Error: "Resource not accessible by integration"
   - Solution: Ensure workflow permissions are set to "Read and write"

2. **Git Push Failures**
   - Error: "GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests"
   - Solution: Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

3. **Workflow Trigger Issues**
   - Error: Workflows not triggering each other
   - Solution: Ensure `GITHUB_TOKEN` has sufficient permissions and "Read and write permissions" is enabled
