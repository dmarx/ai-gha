## GitHub Pages

### Requirements

1. **Public Repository**
   - GitHub Pages is available out-of-the-box for public repositories
   - For private repositories, a GitHub Enterprise plan is required
   - If you plan to make your repository public later, you can still set up and test the site generation locally

2. **Repository Settings**
   - Once your repository is public (or on an Enterprise plan):
     - Go to Repository Settings → Pages
     - Under "Build and deployment":
       - Set Source to "GitHub Actions"

### Installation

```bash
# Install with site generation dependencies
pip install -e ".[all]"
```

### Local Development

The site generator can be used locally regardless of repository visibility:

```bash
# Generate site locally
python -m site_generator build

# Site will be generated in _site/ directory (git-ignored)
# View the generated site by opening _site/index.html in your browser
```

### GitHub Actions Integration

When requirements are met (public repository or Enterprise plan), the site automatically rebuilds and deploys when:
- The README is updated through the `build-readme` workflow
- The deployment workflow is modified
- The workflow is manually triggered

### File Structure

```
your-repo/
├── _site/           # Generated directory (git-ignored)
│   └── index.html   # Generated site
├── docs/
│   └── site/       
│       └── template.html  # Site template
└── src/
    └── site_generator/   # Generator package
```

### Customization

The site template is located in `docs/site/template.html` and can be customized with:
- Custom CSS styles
- Additional JavaScript
- Modified layout and structure
- Custom header/footer content

### Command Line Usage

```bash
# Generate site with default settings
python -m site_generator build

# Specify custom output directory
python -m site_generator build --output_dir="custom_dir"
```

### Testing

The site generation can be tested locally even if GitHub Pages deployment isn't available:
```bash
# Run the test suite
pytest tests/test_site_generator.py
```
