## Introduction

This is a template repository that provides a foundation for GitHub Action-based agents. It includes a modular system for dynamic documentation generation and other reusable components that make it easier to build and maintain agent-driven workflows.

### Key Features

- Modular documentation system with Jinja2 templates
- Automatic project structure documentation
- Reusable GitHub Actions workflows
- Centralized configuration management
- Utility functions for common operations
- Clean, maintainable architecture optimized for AI agents
- Built-in test framework with pytest
- Automated workflow dependencies
- Git operations handled through utilities
## Repository Setup

### Required Repository Settings

1. **Workflow Permissions**
   - Go to Repository Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions
   - Enable "Read and write permissions"
   - Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

2. **Branch Protection** (Optional but recommended)
   - Go to Repository Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules
   - Add rule for your main branch (e.g., `main` or `master`)
   - Enable:
     - "Require pull request reviews before merging"
     - "Require status checks to pass before merging"
   - Allow:
     - "Allow specific actors to bypass required pull requests"
     - Add "github-actions[bot]" to the bypass list

### Required Secrets and Variables

No additional secrets are required for basic functionality. The workflows use the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` which is automatically provided.

### Repository Setup Commands

If you're setting up using GitHub CLI, you can run these commands:
```bash
# Enable workflows
gh repo edit --enable-actions

# Set workflow permissions
gh api \
  --method PUT \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  "/repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/permissions/workflow" \
  -f default_workflow_permissions='write' \
  -F can_approve_pull_request_reviews=true

# Enable Issues (recommended for tracking)
gh repo edit --enable-issues
```

Replace `OWNER/REPO` with your repository details.

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow Permission Errors**
   - Error: "Resource not accessible by integration"
   - Solution: Ensure workflow permissions are set to "Read and write"

2. **Git Push Failures**
   - Error: "GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests"
   - Solution: Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

3. **Workflow Trigger Issues**
   - Error: Workflows not triggering each other
   - Solution: Ensure `GITHUB_TOKEN` has sufficient permissions and "Read and write permissions" is enabled
## Usage

### Installation

This project is designed to be used as a template repository. To get started:

1. Click "Use this template" on GitHub
2. Clone your new repository
3. Install the development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[test]"
   ```

### Dynamic README Generation

The README is automatically generated from templates in `docs/readme/`. The system works as follows:

1. Base template (`docs/readme/base.md.j2`) defines the overall structure
2. Individual sections are stored in `docs/readme/sections/` as separate templates
3. Configuration is centralized in `pyproject.toml`
4. GitHub Actions automatically rebuild the README when:
   - Templates are modified
   - Project structure changes
   - Configuration is updated

To manually trigger a README rebuild:
```bash
python -m readme_generator readme
```

### Project Structure Management

The repository includes automatic project structure documentation:

1. Structure is updated on file changes
2. Tree output is formatted as a template
3. README is automatically rebuilt to include the new structure

To manually update the structure:
```bash
python -m readme_generator structure
```

### Testing

The project uses pytest for testing. To run tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=readme_generator

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_tree_generator.py
```

Tests are automatically run:
- On every push to main
- When workflows are triggered
- Before README updates
- Before structure updates

### Development

This project follows a modular design principle to make it easier for AI agents to work with the codebase:

- Each component is self-contained and focused
- Configuration is centralized in `pyproject.toml`
- Utilities are designed to be reusable across workflows
- Git operations are handled through utility functions
- All features are tested using pytest

To add new README sections:
1. Create a new template in `docs/readme/sections/`
2. Include it in `docs/readme/base.md.j2`
3. Add any necessary configuration to `pyproject.toml`
4. Add tests for new functionality
## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization for LLM Interaction

When developing this project (or using it as a template), keep in mind these guidelines for effective collaboration with Large Language Models:

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Each package should have a single, clear responsibility
   - New features should be separate packages when appropriate
   - Avoid coupling between packages
   - Use consistent patterns across packages, but implement independently
   - Cross-cutting concerns should use shared conventions

2. **File Length and Modularity**
   - Keep files short and focused on a single responsibility
   - If you find yourself using comments like "... rest remains the same" or "... etc", the file is too long
   - Files should be completely replaceable in a single LLM interaction
   - Long files should be split into logical components

3. **Dependencies**
   - All dependencies managed in `pyproject.toml`
   - Optional dependencies grouped by feature:
     ```toml
     [project.optional-dependencies]
     test = ["pytest", ...]
     site = ["markdown2", ...]
     all = ["pytest", "markdown2", ...]  # Everything
     ```
   - Use appropriate groups during development:
     ```bash
     pip install -e ".[test]"  # Just testing
     pip install -e ".[all]"   # Everything
     ```

4. **Testing Standards**
   - Every new feature needs tests
   - Tests should be clear and focused
   - Use pytest fixtures for common setups
   - All workflows depend on tests passing
   - Test files should follow same modularity principles

5. **Why This Matters**
   - LLMs work best with clear, focused contexts
   - Complete file contents are better than partial updates with ellipsis
   - Tests provide clear examples of intended behavior
   - Shorter files make it easier for LLMs to:
     - Understand the complete context
     - Suggest accurate modifications
     - Maintain consistency
     - Avoid potential errors from incomplete information

6. **Real World Example**
   Our own organization follows these principles:
   ```
   src/
   ├── readme_generator/  # Core README generation
   │   ├── generators/
   │   └── utils.py
   └── site_generator/    # Demo site generation
       ├── generator.py
       └── __main__.py
   ```

7. **Best Practices**
   - Aim for files under 200 lines
   - Each file should have a single, clear purpose
   - Use directory structure to organize related components
   - Prefer many small files over few large files
   - Consider splitting when files require partial updates
   - Write tests alongside new features
   - Run tests locally before pushing
# LLM-Focused Summary System

## Overview
The project includes an automated summary generation system designed to help LLMs efficiently work with the codebase. This system generates both local directory summaries and project-wide summaries to provide focused, relevant context for different tasks.

## Types of Summaries

### Directory Summaries
Each directory in the project contains a `SUMMARY` file that concatenates all text files in that directory. This provides focused, local context when working on directory-specific tasks.

### Project-Wide Summaries
Special project-wide summaries are maintained in the `SUMMARIES/` directory on the `summaries` branch:

- `READMEs.md`: Concatenation of all README files in the project
- `README_SUBs.md`: Same as above but excluding the root README
- `PYTHON.md`: Structured view of all Python code including:
  - Function and class signatures
  - Type hints
  - Docstrings
  - Clear indication of class membership

## Accessing Summaries

### Directory Summaries
These are available on any branch in their respective directories:
```bash
# Example: View summary for the readme_generator package
cat src/readme_generator/SUMMARY
```

### Project-Wide Summaries
These live exclusively on the `summaries` branch:
```bash
# Switch to summaries branch
git checkout summaries

# View available summaries
ls SUMMARIES/
```

## Using Summaries Effectively

### For Local Development
Directory summaries are useful when:
- Getting up to speed on a specific package
- Understanding local code context
- Planning modifications to a package

### For Project-Wide Understanding
The `SUMMARIES/` directory helps with:
- Understanding overall project structure
- Finding relevant code across packages
- Reviewing API signatures and documentation
- Planning cross-package changes

### For LLM Interactions
- Point LLMs to specific summaries based on the task
- Use directory summaries for focused work
- Use project-wide summaries for architectural decisions
- Combine different summaries as needed for context

## Implementation Notes
- Summaries are automatically updated on every push to `main`
- The `summaries` branch is workflow-owned and force-pushed on updates
- Summary generation is configured in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.summary]`
- Don't modify summaries directly - they're automatically generated
## GitHub Pages

### Requirements

1. **Public Repository**
   - GitHub Pages is available out-of-the-box for public repositories
   - For private repositories, a GitHub Enterprise plan is required
   - If you plan to make your repository public later, you can still set up and test the site generation locally

2. **Repository Settings**
   - Once your repository is public (or on an Enterprise plan):
     - Go to Repository Settings → Pages
     - Under "Build and deployment":
       - Set Source to "GitHub Actions"

### Installation

```bash
# Install with site generation dependencies
pip install -e ".[all]"
```

### Local Development

The site generator can be used locally regardless of repository visibility:

```bash
# Generate site locally
python -m site_generator build

# Site will be generated in _site/ directory (git-ignored)
# View the generated site by opening _site/index.html in your browser
```

### GitHub Actions Integration

When requirements are met (public repository or Enterprise plan), the site automatically rebuilds and deploys when:
- The README is updated through the `build-readme` workflow
- The deployment workflow is modified
- The workflow is manually triggered

### File Structure

```
your-repo/
├── _site/           # Generated directory (git-ignored)
│   └── index.html   # Generated site
├── docs/
│   └── site/       
│       └── template.html  # Site template
└── src/
    └── site_generator/   # Generator package
```

### Customization

The site template is located in `docs/site/template.html` and can be customized with:
- Custom CSS styles
- Additional JavaScript
- Modified layout and structure
- Custom header/footer content

### Command Line Usage

```bash
# Generate site with default settings
python -m site_generator build

# Specify custom output directory
python -m site_generator build --output_dir="custom_dir"
```

### Testing

The site generation can be tested locally even if GitHub Pages deployment isn't available:
```bash
# Run the test suite
pytest tests/test_site_generator.py
```
